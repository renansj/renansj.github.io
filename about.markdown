Hi, my name is Renan Zapelini i actually work as fullstack developer, but i’m also math and web app security enthusiast, functional programming lover, Linux and open source evangelist.

I would like to finish my Ph.D before mine 40’s, haha

I’m still trying to get better my category theory knowledge because this is the area that i wanna research.

At last but not least, i love animals, so stay with this picture of a happy doggo.
