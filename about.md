Hey, I’m Renan Zapelini, Software Engineer and Application Security Engineer. I spend a lot of my time breaking things (the right way) and figuring out how they really work. For me, security isn’t just a job, it’s about understanding systems at their core and making them stronger.

Every now and then, I jump into bug bounty hunting. There’s nothing like the thrill of finding a vulnerability that everyone else missed and turning it into something that actually helps secure the internet. It’s the perfect mix of curiosity, persistence, and a bit of chaos.

I’m also really into mathematics and functional programming. Clean logic, solid reasoning, elegant solutions. That’s the kind of stuff that makes good code great. It’s not about reinventing the wheel, it’s about understanding how the wheel spins.

This space is where I drop what I learn. Security tricks, bug bounty war stories, math ideas that actually matter in code, and functional programming experiments. No fluff. Just real stuff.

If you’re into hacking, security, or just enjoy taking systems apart and putting them back together better than before, let’s talk. I’m always down to share ideas, learn something new, or build something cool.
